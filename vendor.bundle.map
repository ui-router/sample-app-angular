UI-Router viewport directive, which is filled in by a view (component) on a state.\n *\n * ### Selector\n *\n * A `ui-view` directive can be created as an element: `<ui-view></ui-view>` or as an attribute: `<div ui-view></div>`.\n *\n * ### Purpose\n *\n * This directive is used in a Component template (or as the root component) to create a viewport.  The viewport\n * is filled in by a view (as defined by a [[Ng2ViewDeclaration]] inside a [[Ng2StateDeclaration]]) when the view's\n * state has been activated.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```js\n * // This app has two states, 'foo' and 'bar'\n * stateRegistry.register({ name: 'foo', url: '/foo', component: FooComponent });\n * stateRegistry.register({ name: 'bar', url: '/bar', component: BarComponent });\n * ```\n * ```html\n * <!-- This ui-view will be filled in by the foo state's component or\n *      the bar state's component when the foo or bar state is activated -->\n * <ui-view></ui-view>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Named ui-views\n *\n * A `ui-view` may optionally be given a name via the attribute value: `<div ui-view='header'></div>`.  *Note:\n * an unnamed `ui-view` is internally named `$default`*.   When a `ui-view` has a name, it will be filled in\n * by a matching named view.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```js\n * stateRegistry.register({\n *   name: 'foo',\n *   url: '/foo',\n *   views: { header: HeaderComponent, $default: FooComponent });\n * ```\n * ```html\n * <!-- When 'foo' state is active, filled by HeaderComponent -->\n * <div ui-view=\"header\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- When 'foo' state is active, filled by FooComponent -->\n * <ui-view></ui-view>\n * ```\n */\nexport var UIView = (function () {\n    function UIView(router, parent, viewContainerRef) {\n        this.router = router;\n        this.viewContainerRef = viewContainerRef;\n        this.uiViewData = {};\n        this.parent = parent;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(UIView.prototype, \"_name\", {\n        set: function (val) { this.name = val; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    UIView.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        var parentFqn = this.parent.fqn;\n        var name = this.name || '$default';\n        this.uiViewData = {\n            $type: 'ng2',\n            id: id++,\n            name: name,\n            fqn: parentFqn ? parentFqn + \".\" + name : name,\n            creationContext: this.parent.context,\n            configUpdated: this.viewConfigUpdated.bind(this),\n            config: undefined\n        };\n        this.deregister = this.router.viewService.registerUIView(this.uiViewData);\n    };\n    UIView.prototype.disposeLast = function () {\n        if (this.componentRef)\n            this.componentRef.destroy();\n        this.componentRef = null;\n    };\n    UIView.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.deregister)\n            this.deregister();\n        this.disposeLast();\n    };\n    /**\n     * The view service is informing us of an updated ViewConfig\n     * (usually because a transition activated some state and its views)\n     */\n    UIView.prototype.viewConfigUpdated = function (config) {\n        // The config may be undefined if there is nothing currently targeting this UIView.\n        // Dispose the current component, if there is one\n        if (!config)\n            return this.disposeLast();\n        // Only care about Ng2 configs\n        if (!(config instanceof Ng2ViewConfig))\n            return;\n        // The \"new\" viewconfig is already applied, so exit early\n        if (this.uiViewData.config === config)\n            return;\n        // This is a new ViewConfig.

The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined\n * using `element_inheritance|properties` syntax.\n *\n * ## Element Inheritance\n *\n * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.\n * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list\n * has identical properties.\n *\n * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n *\n * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `[Element]` element, the super element of all\n * elements.\n *\n * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n *\n * ## Properties\n *\n * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (looseIdentical(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

When clicked, the directive will transition to that state by calling [[StateService.go]],\n * and optionally supply state parameter values and transition options.\n *\n * When this directive is on an anchor tag, it will also add an `href` attribute to the anchor.\n *\n * ### Selector\n *\n * - `[uiSref]`: The directive is created as an attribute on an element, e.g., `<a uiSref></a>`\n *\n * ### Inputs\n *\n * - `uiSref`: the target state's name, e.g., `uiSref=\"foostate\"`.  If a component template uses a relative `uiSref`,\n * e.g., `uiSref=\".child\"`, the reference is relative to that component's state.\n *\n * - `uiParams`: any target state parameter values, as an object, e.g., `[uiParams]=\"{ fooId: bar.fooId }\"`\n *\n * - `uiOptions`: [[TransitionOptions]], e.g., `[uiOptions]=\"{ inherit: false }\"`\n *\n * @example\n * ```html\n *\n * <!-- Targets bar state' -->\n * <a uiSref=\"bar\">Bar</a>\n *\n * <!-- Assume this component's state is \"foo\".\n *      Relatively targets \"foo.child\" -->\n * <a uiSref=\".child\">Foo Child</a>\n *\n * <!-- Targets \"bar\" state and supplies parameter value -->\n * <a uiSref=\"bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ barId: foo.barId }\">Bar {{foo.barId}}</a>\n *\n * <!-- Targets \"bar\" state and parameter, doesn't inherit existing parameters-->\n * <a uiSref=\"bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ barId: foo.barId }\" [uiOptions]=\"{ inherit: false }\">Bar {{foo.barId}}</a>\n * ```\n */\nexport var UISref = (function () {\n    function UISref(_router, _anchorUISref, parent) {\n        var _this = this;\n        /**\n         * An observable (ReplaySubject) of the state this UISref is targeting.\n         * When the UISref is clicked, it will transition to this [[TargetState]].\n         */\n        this.targetState$ = new ReplaySubject(1);\n        /** @internalapi */ this._emit = false;\n        this._router = _router;\n        this._anchorUISref = _anchorUISref;\n        this.parent = parent;\n        this._statesSub = _router.globals.states$.subscribe(function () { return _this.update();

For an transition\n * to animate to\n * a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation states} is expected\n * to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the\n * previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition is\n * defined that\n * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n * animation\n * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ animationData = Array.isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) : steps;\n    return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n}\n/**\n * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

when its associated `uiSref` link is active.\n *\n * ### Purpose\n *\n * This directive should be paired with one (or more) [[UISref]] directives.\n * It will apply a CSS class to its element when the state the `uiSref` targets is activated.\n *\n * This can be used to create navigation UI where the active link is highlighted.\n *\n * ### Selectors\n *\n * - `[uiSrefActive]`: When this selector is used, the class is added when the target state or any\n * child of the target state is active\n * - `[uiSrefActiveEq]`: When this selector is used, the class is added when the target state is\n * exactly active (the class is not added if a child of the target state is active).\n *\n * ### Inputs\n *\n * - `uiSrefActive`/`uiSrefActiveEq`: one or more CSS classes to add to the element, when the `uiSref` is active\n *\n * #### Example:\n * The anchor tag has the `active` class added when the `foo` state is active.\n * ```html\n * <a uiSref=\"foo\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Foo</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Matching parameters\n *\n * If the `uiSref` includes parameters, the current state must be active, *and* the parameter values must match.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * The first anchor tag has the `active` class added when the `foo.bar` state is active and the `id` parameter\n * equals 25.\n * The second anchor tag has the `active` class added when the `foo.bar` state is active and the `id` parameter\n * equals 32.\n * ```html\n * <a uiSref=\"foo.bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ id: 25 }\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Bar #25</a>\n * <a uiSref=\"foo.bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ id: 32 }\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Bar #32</a>\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example:\n * A list of anchor tags are created for a list of `bar` objects.\n * An anchor tag will have the `active` class when `foo.bar` state is active and the `id` parameter matches\n * that object's `id`.\n * ```html\n * <li *ngFor=\"let bar of bars\">\n *   <a uiSref=\"foo.bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ id: bar.id }\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Bar #{{ bar.id }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Multiple uiSrefs\n *\n * A single `uiSrefActive` can be used for multiple `uiSref` links.\n * This can be used to create (for example) a drop down navigation menu, where the menui is highlighted\n * if *any* of its inner links are active.\n *\n * The `uiSrefActive` should be placed on an ancestor element of the `uiSref` list.\n * If anyof the `uiSref` links are activated, the class will be added to the ancestor element.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This is a dropdown nagivation menu for \"Admin\" states.\n * When any of `admin.users`, `admin.groups`, `admin.settings` are active, the `<li>` for the dropdown\n * has the `dropdown-child-active` class applied.\n * Additionally, the active anchor tag has the `active` class applied.\n * ```html\n * <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\">\n *   <li uiSrefActive=\"dropdown-child-active\" class=\"dropdown admin\">\n *     Admin\n *     <ul>\n *       <li><a uiSref=\"admin.users\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Users</a></li>\n *       <li><a uiSref=\"admin.groups\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Groups</a></li>\n *       <li><a uiSref=\"admin.settings\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Settings</a></li>\n *     </ul>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n */\nexport var UISrefActive = (function () {\n    function UISrefActive(uiSrefStatus, rnd, host) {\n        var

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
